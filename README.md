# John's adventofcode 2020
My entries for [adventofcode 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020).
Trying out [Löve](https://love2d.org/) with [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) in the process.

## How to run the solutions
You will need to have Löve installed and available in your path. Run `love . [day]` in the root folder, e.g. `love 1`. To run the second task of a day run `love . [day] 2`.
